The cam-assisted blocking function makes belaying more convenient when a climber is working a route or when catching a fall. The design of the handled camming mechanism enables exceptional descent control. Compact and lightweight, it can be used with all single ropes from 8.5 to 11 mm. \n\tBelay device with cam-assisted blocking, designed for the gym and crag:\n\t- feeding slack and catching falls are accomplished using standard belay techniques, always keeping a hand on the brake side of the rope\n\t- easier belaying, thanks to its cam-assisted blocking: when the climber falls or is at rest, the rope tightens, making the cam pivot to pinch and block the rope\n\t- cam-assisted blocking offers leeway for the brake-side hand position, regardless of the angle between the climber side and brake side of the ropes\n\t- rope installation diagram engraved on both the inside and outside of the device\n\tExceptional convenience when lowering:\n\t- the ergonomic handle allows you to easily unblock the rope and lower someone\n\t- easily controlled and progressive rope feed provides smooth and comfortable descent\n\t- 3:1 mechanical advantage of the handled camming mechanism helps control rope feed on small-diameter ropes and requires less effort on the handle for large-diameter ropes\n\tIntended for all users:\n\t- simple to use for belaying both lead and top-rope climbers\n\t- optimally balanced design: lightweight (175 g), compact and durable\n\t- compatible with all 8.5 to 11 mm dynamic single ropes and optimized for those 8.9 to 10.5 mm\n","oldprice":0,"characteristics":"","catid":""},{"name":"Petzl Boreo Helmet Blue","price":"223","images":"https://shop.mplus.ge//files/products/bULZj5dbwGDf3HtH32gLTzmjTOtvFw.jpeg","article":3537,"shortdescription":"Durable and versatile helmet with enhanced protection for climbing and mountaineeringDurable and very versatile, the BOREO helmet is suitable for climbing, mountaineering, caving, via ferrata, canyoning...
